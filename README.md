## ✨ Project Summary  
This project analyzes the **Air Quality Index (IKU) of Regencies and Cities in North Sumatra for 2022**.  
The objective is to evaluate how well each region achieved its air quality targets, identify disparities, and recommend interventions for improvement.  

---

## 📖 Context  
- **Scope**: Air Quality Index (IKU) for **20+ regencies/cities** in North Sumatra.  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - `Target` → Air quality target set by regulation.  
  - `Achievement` → Actual air quality achievement.  
  - `Gap` → Difference between achievement and target.  
- **Objective**: Determine to what extent air quality targets were met at both regency/city and provincial levels.  

---

## 🔎 Insights  

### 📊 Provincial Overview  
- As a whole, **North Sumatra Province** met the average target.  
- Provincial-level gap is relatively small (close to 0).  

### 🥇 Top Performing Regions  
- **Toba (+9.9)**, **Central Tapanuli**, and **Dairi** regencies → exceeded targets significantly.  
- These regions can be considered **best performers**.  

### ⚠️ Underperforming Regions  
- **Medan (-8.0)**, **Deli Serdang**, and **Serdang Bedagai** are far below target.  
- Underperformance likely linked to **urbanization, transportation pollution, and industrial activity**.  

### 📈 Stable Regions  
- Most other regencies/cities are near target (gap ±2) → relatively stable performance.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations  

### 🔍 Benchmarking Best Practices  
- Study **Toba, Central Tapanuli, and Dairi** to identify success factors.  
- Apply similar environmental management practices in other areas, especially urban centers.  

### 🚨 Priority Interventions  
- Focus policy efforts on **Medan, Deli Serdang, and Serdang Bedagai**.  
- Evaluate and strengthen regulations on **transportation, industrial emissions, and urban air quality management**.  

### 🌍 Provincial Strategy  
- Despite achieving targets overall, **reduce disparities** between rural and urban areas.  
- Establish **continuous annual monitoring** and maintain an **interactive dashboard** to detect trends early.
